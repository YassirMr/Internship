# Internship
In the context of my internship, my mission was to characterize the anechoic chamber R2lab for the purpose of being able to evaluate wireless protocols inside of it. 
Thus this repository will contain the code that I made to generate results.
NB: The code to get values of the metric chosen, namely the received signal strength is not mine, therefore I can not put it here. To take a look at it visit: https://github.com/parmentelat/r2lab/tree/public/demos/radiomap
