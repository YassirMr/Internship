# Internship
In the context of my internship, my mission was to characterize the anechoic chamber R2lab for the purpose of being able to evaluate wireless protocols inside of it. 
Thus this repository will contain the code that I used to generate the metric chosen to assess the lab, which is the received signal strength, and the codes that I used to generate results.
