# Internship
In the context of my internship, my mission was to characterize the anechoic chamber R2lab for the purpose of being able to evaluate wireless protocols inside of it. 
Thus this repository will contain the code to get values of the metric chosen, namely the received signal strength, and the scripts that I made to generate results.
NB: The code to get values of the RSSI is not mine. I nonless put it here because I made various modifications to it and because its result is used by the other scripts.
To take a look at it visit: https://github.com/parmentelat/r2lab/tree/public/demos/radiomap
